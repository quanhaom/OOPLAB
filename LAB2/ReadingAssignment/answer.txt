When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods (getters and setters) should only be used when necessary, and not as a default for all instance variables. According to Holub, exposing instance variables through accessor methods can lead to poor encapsulation, and makes it harder to change the implementation of the class without affecting clients. He suggests that instead of blindly creating accessor methods for all instance variables, developers should carefully consider which variables should be exposed, and which should be kept private. In general, accessor methods should only be created for instance variables that need to be read or modified by clients of the class.

If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows me to create multiple constructor methods within a class as long as they have different method signatures. This is known as constructor overloading. In this case, I can have a constructor that takes a title parameter and another constructor that takes a category parameter, as long as the parameter types and/or order of parameters are different.
